 Blog Post Manager
A simple frontend app to view, add, edit, and delete blog posts using a mock REST API via jsonâ€‘server.

Learning Goals
GET posts from an API and render them in the DOM

Handle user interactions (clicks, form submissions)

(Advanced) Send POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests

Apply DOM updates responsively and manage app state

 Demo Flow
On load, the app fetches and displays a list of all post titles (with images).

Clicking a title loads full post details (title, content, author, image).

A form lets users add a new post (client-side for Core; persists with POST in Advanced).

Clicking Edit opens a form to change title/content (client-only for Core; PATCH to API in Advanced).

Clicking Delete removes the post (client-only for Core; DELETE to API in Advanced).

 Usage Walkthrough
Viewing posts
On load, displayPosts() fetches all posts and displays them in #post-list.

Selecting a post
Clicking a post title triggers handlePostClick(id), loading data into the detail pane.

Adding a post
The #new-post-form is handled by addNewPostListener(), which creates a new post clientâ€‘side or sends POST when advanced behavior is enabled.

Editing a post
Clicking Edit reveals the #edit-post-form. Upon submit, the post is updated in the DOM or via PATCH for persistence.

Deleting a post
The Delete button removes the post from view or calls DELETE and refreshes the list when API-backed
